# shove-dominate
piece for bitpanic ensemble for dogstar 2016.

Run: sixthversion-plain.maxpat

Requires:
* Max runtime, 5 6 or 7 should work, but I built it on 5
* Audio interface with a minimum of two inputs and two outputs
* Your “sound” that you can generate however you want (I’m using my synth) in input 2.
* One speaker
* One extra audio cable to send your output 1 to someone else.
